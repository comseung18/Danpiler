# Danpiler
This is the Danpiler project, where I implement everything from lexical analysis to intermediate code generation and optimization based on "Compilers: Principles, Techniques & Tools."

## Lexical Analyzer

### NFA
Given a **regular expression**, it is converted into an **NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton)**, which can then be visualized graphically.

The input regular expression can be converted into an [NFA](src/main/kotlin/NFA.kt). The resulting NFA can be used for regular expression matching. Refer to [NFATest.kt](src/test/kotlin/tc/NFATest.kt) for details.

#### Example: Regular Expression `(a|b)*abb`
NFA construction process and result:

### DFA
A given **regular expression** is converted into an **NFA** and then transformed into a **DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton)**, which can be visualized graphically.
DFA provides more efficient regular expression matching than NFA by minimizing unnecessary states.

#### Example: Conversion from NFA to DFA
DFA transformation process and result:

### Direct DFA
A **regular expression** is converted directly into a DFA without passing through an NFA. This approach can result in fewer states compared to the traditional NFA-to-DFA transformation.

## **Parser Implementation (LR(0) → SLR(1) → LR(1) → LALR(1))**

### **1. LR(1) Parsing Implementation**
LR(1) parsing extends SLR(1) by incorporating **Lookahead symbols**, allowing for more precise parsing decisions.
This approach prevents conflicts that occur in SLR(1) when FollowSets are not sufficient.

#### Example: LR(1) Parsing State Graph
To demonstrate LR(1) parsing, the following expression grammar is used:

```
<E> ::= <E> "+" <T> | <T>
<T> ::= <T> "*" <F> | <F>
<F> ::= "(" <E> ")" | "id"
```

Generated LR(1) state graph:
![LR(1) Parsing State Graph](src/test/kotlin/docsimage/lr1_example.png)

The LR(1) parsing state graph contains a large number of states, making it complex and difficult to interpret.

### **2. LALR(1) Optimization**
Although LR(1) parsing is powerful, it introduces a large number of states due to its use of Lookaheads.
LALR(1) parsing optimizes this by merging LR(1) states that share the same LR(0) core while combining Lookaheads.

This allows for a more efficient parsing table while maintaining LR(1) parsing accuracy.

#### Example: LALR(1) Parsing State Graph
![LALR(1) Parsing State Graph](src/test/kotlin/docsimage/lalr_example.png)
As you can see, the number of states is significantly reduced.

### **3. Action & Goto Table Construction**
LALR(1) operates using **compressed LR(1) tables**, maintaining strong parsing capabilities while reducing state complexity.

```kotlin
override fun action(s: Int, terminalItem: TerminalItem): Action {
    var j = goto[s to terminalItem]
    if (j != null) {
        return Action.Shift(j)
    }

    val c = lr1CollectionMap[s]!!
    val reduceItems = c.items.filter { it.dotIndex == it.production.size &&
            it.lookAhead.contains(terminalItem)
    }
    if (reduceItems.size > 1) {
        throw IllegalArgumentException("grammar is not LALR(1)")
    }

    val reduceItem = reduceItems.firstOrNull()

    if (reduceItem != null) {
        if (reduceItem.nonTerminal == NonTerminalItem(root.name + "`") && terminalItem == endTerminalItem) {
            return Action.Accept
        }
        return Action.Reduce(reduceItem.nonTerminal, reduceItem.production)
    }

    return Action.Error
}
```
This function enables **Shift, Reduce, Accept, and Error actions** efficiently in the LALR(1) parsing model.

## **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Implementation**

### **DanLang: A Custom Programming Language**
DanLang is a C-like programming language designed for educational purposes. It includes:
- Primitive data types: `int`, `float`, `string`, `boolean`
- Statements ending with `;`
- Control structures: `for`, `while`, `if`, `else if`, `else`
- Functions with a return type, parameters, and block scope
- Classes with member variables and functions (no inheritance)
- Object creation using `new` and memory deallocation with `delete`
- Operator precedence: `*`, `/` have higher precedence than `+`, `-`

### **AST Representation in DanLang**
DanLang's AST is built using `DanLangASTNode` structures, where each non-terminal has a corresponding node type.

#### Example: AST for 
```
int main() {
    int x = 3 + 4 * 5;
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Example AST Visualization**

## **Next Steps**
- **Semantic Analysis**: Type checking, variable scope validation
- **Intermediate Code Generation**: Convert AST to three-address code (TAC)
- **Optimization & Code Generation**: Dead code elimination, register allocation

DanLang is now a fully functional language, with parsing and AST generation successfully implemented! 🚀
